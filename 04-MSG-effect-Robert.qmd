## The Madison Square Garden Effect in the NBA {#sec-robert}

### What is Madison Square Garden?

MSG, or “The Garden”, is a historic arena located in the heart of Manhattan. The Garden opened on February 11, 1968, making it the oldest major sporting facility in the New York metropolitan area and the oldest active arena in the NBA. Beyond basketball, the arena hosts concerts, boxing matches, political events, and other major cultural performances, making it one of the most recognizable venues in the world. The Garden is especially iconic in the world of basketball, with many revering it as the “Mecca of Basketball”.

### What makes MSG so special?

MSG is the premier indoor venue of New York City--the most visited and densely populated city in the United States, as well as the nation’s largest media market. Events held at MSG often receive disproportionate national and international attention, and NBA games played at The Garden are more likely to be nationally televised, widely discussed in sports media, and preserved in highlight compilations than games played elsewhere.

MSG is also the home court of the New York Knicks, one of the NBA’s most valuable and widely followed franchises, regardless of on-court success. Knicks fans are notoriously vocal, expressive, and unafraid to engage with players. Courtside seats are typically filled with famous actors, musicians, athletes, and public figures, many of whom are highlighted on broadcasts and arena displays. On any given night, there are dozens of high-profile celebrities present throughout the arena, creating a feeling that the game is a public showcase, rather than just another regular-season game. Given the arena’s historic status, visibility, and the fans it brings in, performances at MSG are perceived as particularly meaningful and memorable.

In line with this, MSG boasts a long list of iconic player performances. Michael Jordan scored 55 points in his “double-nickel” return game to MSG on March 28, 1995 after his first retirement, definitively reinstating himself as the face of the league. On February 2, 2009, Kobe Bryant set the record for most points scored in a game at The Garden with a 61-point performance, solidifying his legacy as one of the best scorers the NBA has ever seen. Stephen Curry’s breakout game on February 27, 2013, where he made 11 out of his 13 three-point attempts to score 54 points at The Garden, is often referenced as the moment he elevated to star status. Nearly nine years later at The Garden, Curry hit his 2974th career three-pointer, surpassing Ray Allen and breaking the NBA’s all-time three point scoring record. The list goes on.

This combination of historical performances, celebrity presence, media visibility, and competitive intensity has brought on a widely-accepted narrative that the pressures associated with MSG uniquely influence individual games and player performances. Clutch star players rise to the occasion with standout performances, while others “shrink under the lights” and struggle to perform, further entrenching the belief that the arena itself exerts an influence on performance.

### Is the MSG effect real?

While perceptions of the “MSG Effect” are deeply ingrained in basketball culture, they are rooted in isolated moments, media framing, and retrospective storytelling rather than statistics. The present analysis seeks to address this gap by examining whether this “MSG Effect” is actually detectable in statistics, or if it is simply a product of our narrative-obsessed imagination.

### Three overarching research questions:

#### Q1: Do the New York Knicks experience a special home-court advantage due to playing at MSG?

#### Q2: Do visiting players play differently at MSG than other arenas?

#### Q3: Who benefits the most from playing at MSG?

#### Where do the Knicks rank in terms of home court advantage?

```{r}
#| label: tbl-question2a
# Let's find each team's home court advantage (average total points scored at home - average total points scored away). 

non_nba_teams <- c("EAST", "WEST", "USA", "WORLD", "GIA", "LEB")

```

#### New York's home court advantage ranks 23rd on the list of NBA teams, placing them in the bottom third of the league. However, their home–away scoring differential was close to the league average, indicating that Madison Square Garden does not confer a markedly weaker or stronger team-level advantage.

#### Compared to other away games, players shoot more efficiently, turn the ball over less often, and produce more defensive stats when they play away games at MSG. This supports the notion that playing at MSG may elevate performances more than playing at other stadiums, at least for visiting players. This leads us to our next question.

## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Q3: Who benefits the most from playing at MSG?

### Which players put up the best performances at MSG? (min = 8 games played at MSG)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important note about the data

The figures below use data from **away games played at Madison Square Garden (MSG)**.  
Because Knicks players do not play away games at MSG, their “MSG” data reflects games they played **at MSG as members of other teams**, not as Knicks.

#### Durant, Harden, Cunningham, and other players in the top right quadrant play better overall at MSG compared to other away games. Butler, Haliburton, Sengun, and other players in the bottom left quadrant perform worse overall. Wembanyama and other players in the bottom right quadrant produce more stats but do so less efficiently at MSG.

#### *Brunson and Randle's games as Knicks players were not included in these analyses.*

## Conclusion: Is the MSG Effect detectable?

### On an individual player performance level: yes.

#### Our analyses from Q2 showed that visiting players shot more efficiently, turned the ball over less, and produced more defensive stats on average playing at MSG compared to other away games. This supports the notion that visiting players may be more "locked in" on average for games at The Garden. Analyses from Q3 answered who rose to the occasion vs. who choked under the pressure of The Garden. Some players consistently performed better at MSG, while others performed worse. These are the players who seem to be most influenced by the MSG Effect, positively and negatively.

#### Overall, these findings suggest that Madison Square Garden functions less as a traditional home court advantage and more as a high-visibility performance context that accentuates player-specific responses to pressure, attention, and atmosphere.
