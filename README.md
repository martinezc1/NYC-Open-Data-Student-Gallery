## 📚 About the Project
This gallery is built using **Quarto** and **R**. Central to this project is the [`nycOpenData` R package](https://martinezc1.github.io/nycOpenData/), which provides a seamless interface for students to discover, filter, and import real-time datasets directly from the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). 

By leveraging the tools provided in the [Package Documentation](https://martinezc1.github.io/nycOpenData/), students moved beyond static spreadsheets to work with live city data, covering topics such as:
* **311 Service Requests & Social Infrastructure**
* **Urban Wildlife & Tree Census Data**
* **Environmental Stressors & Toxic Homes**
* **Public Health & Food Safety**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Workflow
* **Language:** R
* **Data Access:** [`nycOpenData` Package](https://martinezc1.github.io/nycOpenData/)
* **Engine:** Quarto
* **Deployment:** Posit Connect (Cloud)
